# JSON-based-Inventory-Management-System
**Inventory Management System** based on **JSON** coded in Python &amp; Jupyter Notebook

This Inventory Management System uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to store data on stock details and sales details.
Here, I have provided
* stock.json - JSON file that contains details on stocks like Product ID, Name, Quantity available and Last updated time for about 35 unique products
* sales.json - JSON file that contains about 10 transactions with unique transaction ID for each purchase and also the product details with amount
* The Transaction ID is of format - that tells you the date &amp; time of purchase with Product ID in it
* Sample Format: *2021Sep6#11:14:58#1032*    
* Syntax: ```YYYY + Month&Date + # + Time + # + Product ID```

This project is created as part of my internship on **Python for AI/ML** by **ETG**  <br />
